Welcome to my Fizzbuzz repo! It is divided into three parts:

Fizzbuzz

Here I have simple solutions to the original FizzBuzz question using the modulus to find out if a number is divisible by (or a multiple of) 3 and/or 5. The way you will find out your result is by the answer that prints. If you receive "FizzBuzz", it is a multiple of both 3 and 5. If you receive "Fizz" it is just 3. If "Buzz", then it is just 5. Finally, if you receive the number back then it is not divisible by 3 or 5. Why not try again with a different number?

Fizzbuzz_map
Fizzbuzz_map takes the Fizzbuzz solution a step further. In this, we map through a certain range of numbers and print fizz, buzz, sivv (new addition for numbers divisible by 7) or if all else fails - the number itself - using Ruby's map method. 

FizzBuzz extreme!

For those that don't want to be constrained to just 3 or 5. In this dynamic method, you can enter whatever you like. You pick your number, the number you want to see if it is a multiple of and finally the message you'd like to print if you succeed. The possibilites are endless. I have a few selections at the bottom commented out for you to start out with. Feel free to make your own!
